# Discord-Bot-Builder
These are the files my bot builder piece together and modify to make a working bot. This structure is NOT a working bot, and is only part of what you need to make a Discord bot.


You are allowed to use the code in this responsitory, however, when modifying you must keep any credits in the files.
